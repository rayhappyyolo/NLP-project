# NLP-project
Use web scraping and NLP to find the most frequent words in classic literature: Herman Melville's novel, Moby Dick.

Dive into our Python project where we build a data science pipeline to scrape, process, and analyze word frequencies from "Moby Dick" on Project Gutenberg using requests, BeautifulSoup, and nltk. Perfect for visualizing text data from any novel available on the platform.
